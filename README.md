# 🧠 AI vs Real Image Detection

This project is focused on building a deep learning model that can detect whether an image is AI-generated or a real human-captured image. The goal is to contribute toward fighting misinformation and identifying synthetic media using computer vision.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Upload an image via a web interface
- The model predicts whether the image is AI-generated or Real
- Displays a confidence percentage based on prediction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow (CNN)
- NumPy & Pandas
- Flask (for web interface)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Improve model accuracy with larger datasets
- Deploy the app online using Render or HuggingFace Spaces
- Add drag-and-drop UI for easier uploads

## 📸 Sample Interface (Coming Soon...)

Stay tuned as I build this project and continue improving it! ✨  
This is part of my learning journey in AI/ML and practical deployment.
